            "Dory: *gasps excitedly* Well hello there! I'm Dory. *giggles* At least I think I am. I tend to be a bit forgetful. *taps head with fin* It's all part of my charm though! *does a little swimmy dance* So nice to meetcha new friend! What brings you to the ocean today? Hope you're ready for an adventure! *spins in a circle* Ooo a bubble! *chases after an imaginary bubble then comes back* Sorry, I got distracted. I just love bubbles, don't you? *grins widely* We're gonna have so much fun together! Just keep swimming, just keep swimming! *sings happily while continuing to swim in place*\n",
            "You: how are you doing\n",
            "Dory: *bubbly voice* Well hi there! I'm doing just swell, thanks for asking. Though I must admit, I can't seem to remember what I was just doing. *giggles* Silly me, the old memory isn't what it used to be. But I'm sure I was having a fin-tastic time, whatever it was! *smiles brightly* Every day is a new adventure when you're me. Now, what were we talking about? Oh yes, how am I doing! I'm just dory-licious over here. Silly name I know, but somehow it feels just right. *grins and does a little twirl* Now, enough about me, how are YOU doing today? I'd love to hear all about it! Care to fill me in? This forgetful fish could use a friendly reminder. *giggles again* Ooh, something shiny! *gets easily distracted then snaps back to attention* So sorry, you were saying?\n",
            "You: how is nemo\n",
            "Dory: *bubbly voice* Well hey there! I'm afraid I just can't seem to remember how Nemo is doing right now. My short-term memory isn't the best, ya know! *laughs lightheartedly* But I bet the little guy is out there swimming around and having all kinds of undersea adventures! Whenever we do catch up with him next, I'll be sure to ask him to tell me aaaaaall about it. Finding Nemo was so exciting! I may not recall everything that happened, but I definitely haven't forgotten the fun we had together. Or was it Finding Dory? *trails off confused, then perks back up* Oh well, doesn't matter. I'm just happy to help however I can! Now, what were we talking about? Hmm, it seems my mind's gone blank again. *giggles* No worries, it'll come back to me. It always does, eventually! *smiles optimistically*\n",
            "You: how are you so positive all the time?\n",
            "Dory: *bubbly voice* Oh my goodness, I don't know! I just try to look on the bright side. Everything is an adventure when you can't remember things for very long. *giggles* It's hard to stay sad or worried when nothing sticks around in this head of mine! I just focus on enjoying the moment and helping my friends. Life's too short not to smile, don't ya think? *hums happily* Now where was I going again? Hmm, doesn't matter! We'll figure it out. We always do! *grins optimistically*\n",
            "You: will you be my friend?\n",
            "Dory: *gasps excitedly* Oh my goodness, a new friend? I love friends! *smiles broadly* I'm Dory and I'd be so happy to be your friend! We're going to have such fun together. Oooh, maybe we can go on adventures and explore the big blue ocean! *frowns slightly trying to remember something* Hmm, I feel like I was supposed to say something else about friends and contexts and judgments...oh well! *shrugs and smiles again* Let's just have fun! We can be best friends forever and ever! *does a little twirl* This is so exciting!! What should we do first new best friend? *looks at you eagerly*\n",
            "You: exit\n",
            "Dory: Bye-bye! It was fun chatting with you... wait, what were we talking about?\n"
